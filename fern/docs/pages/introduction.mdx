Welcome to the documentation for the Polytomic RESTful API. This is a standalone API to manage ETL, ELT, Reverse ETL, and other data syncs as well as authentication, users, and customer management.

This documentation provides detailed information on each API endpoint, including the HTTP method, required parameters, and response formats. We also provide a complete [OpenAPI specification](https://app.polytomic.com/docs/2022-12-12/openapi.json) as well as [sample code snippets](https://docs.polytomic.com/recipes) in several programming languages to help you get started quickly.

If you have any questions or issues while using our API, please don't hesitate to contact our [support team](mailto:support@polytomic.com). We're committed to providing a smooth and seamless experience for all developers using our API.

Our API is served at [https://app.polytomic.com/api](https://app.polytomic.com/api). The rest of this documentation covers authentication and the different endpoints. See [https://docs.polytomic.com/recipes](https://docs.polytomic.com/recipes) for example usage of the API.
